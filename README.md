bspviewer
=========

Pretty simple: just view a BSP map. This is really more of a project for educational/portfolio purposes than anything else.

It's a fun thing: despite Quake III's file format being written circa 1999, and therefore being extremely old, a lot of techniques with respect to computer graphics and optimization can be harnessed through a project like this.

Current Focuses:

- WebGL support
    * This is at the top of the list, because it's much easier to show something off via the web.
- Vertex deformation (effect shader)
- Texcoord mod functions (effect shader)
