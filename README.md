bspviewer
=========

Pretty simple: just view a BSP map. This is really more of a project for educational purposes than anything else.

The focus right now is on effect shaders; I'm currently in the process of implementing tessellation using some funky barycentric coordinate formulas, which will then be used for vertex deformation coolness.
