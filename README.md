YAQ3R (Yet Another Quake 3 Renderer)
=========

Functionally, it's pretty simple: just view a BSP map. This is really more of a project for educational/portfolio purposes than anything else.

Despite Quake III's file format being written circa 1999, and therefore being extremely old, a lot of techniques with respect to computer graphics and optimization can be harnessed through a project like this.

Current Focuses:

- Performance
	* Lots of shitty code has passed through this repo.
	* It's definitely on its way to getting better.
	* It's improved significantly within the past month or so.

- WebGL support
	* It's much easier to show something off via the web.
	* Emscripten is fantastic.

- Effect Shaders
	* More Vertex deformations.
	* More Texcoord mod functions.
	* Skybox stuff.
	* Various other animations.
