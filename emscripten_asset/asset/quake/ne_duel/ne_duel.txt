FILENAME: ne_duel.pk3
=====================


A 1v1 / 2v2 vq3 and cpma map for Quake 3 Arena.

Creating this map was a unique project involving three Q3 mappers/players working together.

We have worked on this map for 18 Months... (!!!) We have carefully studied other maps, played 'NE' A LOT and then studied the resulting demos. We have worked hard to avoid the things which cause other 1v1 maps to be criticised. In short, it owns. ;)

To get the map working, extract the ne_duel.pk3 and ne_duel.txt files to the baseq3 folder inside your quake3 folder. For example c:/quake3/baseq3 . To load the map type '/map ne_duel' in the q3 console. Or find it in the skirmish menu under tournament maps.

Equim
=====
I did some initial layout designs and construction work for the map. I also neatened up verb's original construction work in preparation for the new graphics work.
More recently I designed and built the current version of the YA "tunnel" area near the MH.


Akuma
=====
Pretty much all the texturing/details/lighting is my work, when I joined the team I rebuilt the map completely to ensure no excess brushes were hiding in there. 'IKbase' was my first choice texture set, though a few others were tried before we finally settled on IKbase ;) I think it's probably the most suitable set for NE. Enjoy!


verb
====
Im responsible for the shape of much of the layout and for the item placement. I did some map building in the early days as it was the best way to show how i thought things could/should be. Equim and now Akuma have both easily overtaken me in terms of building work. Recently im acting as the spokesperson for the map.
