* 1/19/16:
    * Get this running with Emscripten; replace input as necessary.
        - Need to figure out how to use the file system API to iterate the right directories. The object which is returned by FS.lookupPath() appears

    * Pick 2 things you can refactor and then test.
    * Gamma correction.
